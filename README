Environment Requirements:
    1. Python 3.6
    2. Python package - Numpy (pip3 install numpy)
    3. Python package - SciPy (pip3 install scipy)



1.  You can start the program using your IDE feature (like run) to run Main.py or execute the following command in command prompt:
    python3 Main.py

2.  Once you saw the interface, you can start using the test suite.

3.  Input Data - Input Data contains Binary Data, Binary Data File and String Data File
    Binary Data - You can only enter a BINARY STRING here (ex:1100100100001111110110101010001000100001011010001100001000110100110001001100011001100010100010111000)
    Binary Data File - This will open a file dialog where you can select a file to be read by program.
                       The file you selected should contain only one set of data in BINARY FORM.  (For example, please refer to data/data.e)
    String Data File - This will open a file dialog where you can select a file to be read by program.
                       The file you selected can contain multiple set of data in STRING FORM.  (For example, please refer to data/test_data_01.txt)

4.  You can select the type of test you want to perform by clicking the corresponding checkbox or press "Select All Test" to select everything
5.  You can cancele the selection by clicking the corresponding checkbox or press "De-Select All Test" to cancel everything
6.  Once you have your data ready and selected the test you want to perform, then you can press "Execute Test" button to execute the test
7.  The result will be displayed after the test done.
    7.1  There are multiple result for Random Excursion Test.  Initially the program will displayed state '+1'.  You can chechk the other resuld
         by changing the state (using drop down) and press "Update" button
    7.2  There are multiple result for Random Excursion Variant Test.  Initially the program will displayed state '-1.0'.  You can chechk the other resuld
         by changing the state (using drop down) and press "Update" button
8.  You can see your data on the top of "Randomness Testing" (Input Data Drop down) if you have multiple input data.
    You can select the data and press "Change Data" button.  This will update the GUI and display the result of the data you selected.
9.  You can save the result to a text file by pressing "Save as Text File" button.
    This will display a file dialog where you can enter the file name for your result.
    You can check the text file after the result is saved.
10. "Reset" button will clear all input and variables.  It is strongly suggested you use this feature if you want to execute test for another set of data
11. "Exit" button will close this program
